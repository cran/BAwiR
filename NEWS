Version: 1.1 [2018-05-09]
* A minor typo has been corrected in scraping_rosters_acb() and scraping_rosters_euro() to check if the data frame is NULL before adding name columns.
* In the same two functions, the colon notation in the initial loop has been replaced by seq_len to avoid the backwards sequence bug.
* A minor typo has been corrected in do_four_factors_df() to identify the games that every team played.
* get_pop_pyramid_acb() has been corrected to be in line with ggplot2 updates.
