\description{
Offensive Efficiency (OE) is a measure to evaluate the quality of 
offense produced. OE counts the total number of successful offensive 
possessions the player was involved in, regarding the player's total 
number of potential ends of possession. 

This measure is used in the definition of \code{\link{do_EPS}}.
}
\note{
When either both the numerator and denominator of the OE expression 
are 0 or just the denominator is 0, the function returns a 0.
}
\examples{
df <- do_join_games_bio("ACB", acb_games_1718, acb_players_1718)

df1 <- do_add_adv_stats(df)
# Players with OE = 0:
# df1[55, c("Player.x", "FG", "AST", "FGA", "ORB", "TOV")]
# Player.x     FG  AST  FGA  ORB  TOV
# Triguero, J.  0    0    0    0    0
# OE can be greater than 1, for example:
# df1[17, c("Player.x", "FG", "AST", "FGA", "ORB", "TOV")]
# Player.x        FG  AST  FGA  ORB  TOV
# Diagne, Moussa   3    0    3    1    0

do_OE(df1[1,])
